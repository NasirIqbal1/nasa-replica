  "The James Webb Space Telescope has found water ice throughout a dusty debris disk circling the Sun-like star HD 181327. Water ice heavily influences the formation of giant planets and may also be delivered by comets to fully formed rocky planets. Now that researchers have detected water ice with Webb, they have opened the door to studying how these processes play out in new ways.";
